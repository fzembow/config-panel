# Config-panel

Easy way to change and manage configurations for javascript projects.

# TODO

- Ensure config applies to nested elements, eg you should be able to apply config to a parent object for all of its keys
- Add real documentation to README.md
- make sure that callback is changed on load of a preset
- allow saving to overwrite existing preset
- only add the `changed` class if the value is different than the loaded value
- Wrap in anonymous function
- Make into module
